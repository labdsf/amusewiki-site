This is the homepage for the *A路Muse路Wiki* engine. Here you will find documentation and updates about this project.

This engine can work as a read-only site, as a moderated wiki, or as a
fully open wiki.

It strives to be simple and yet powerful enough for long-term
archiving of texts.

*** Features

 - User-friendly markup borrowed from [[http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html][Emacs Muse]]
 - **Importing of HTML** documents preserving most of the logical markup
 - Wide range of output formats, including high-quality **PDF** (via LaTeX) and **EPUB**
 - Automatic generation of PDF for **printing** 
 - **Collection** creation and PDF reformatting, with plenty of layout options
 - Texts are stored under revision control with **Git**
 - Offline editing via Git
 - Fast and accurate **full-text search** (with many available options)
 - **Multisite** engine: on one instance you can run as many sites you want
 - Mail notifications
 - RSS feed
 - Localization via gettext (depending on the language, the coverage varies from complete to zero, but it's easy to add).
 - Multilanguage on the same site is supported

*** Missing features (so far)

 - no talks, comments, etc.
 - no refined access control (only basic)

This site is still under construction and runs on amusewiki itself.

Every wiki has a sandbox, so [[http://sandbox.amusewiki.org][here it is]].

The code is written in Perl and is freely available (under the same
terms as Perl itself) on
[[https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki/releases][github]] and
[[https://gitorious.org/amusewikifarm][gitorious]].
