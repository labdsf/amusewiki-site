This is the homepage for [[/special/about][amusewiki]], a library-oriented wiki engine.

*** Why would I want this engine and not MediaWiki/Drupal/WordPress/whatever?

You should consider amusewiki if:

 - You want **high-quality output** (EPUB and PDF with LaTeX quality).
 - You want a site with a flat-file and **Git** backend for long-term archiving.
 - You want to be able to reformat the PDFs, merging texts into **collections**.
 - You don't want or need fine-grained user permissions.
 - You don't want or need talks, comments, forums, social, etc
   embedded into the site.

[[/special/about][See the feature list for more details.]]
