#teaser Which files to add to the site repository to customize it

Each site is configurable by root and admin users in the console
(=/user/site= or =admin/sites=).

However, part of the configuration should be done adding some files to
the =site_files= directory in the =repo/SITE_ID/= directory, which is
the git repository of the site. See [[offline-editing-via-git]] for
the workflow's details.

 =favicon.ico= :: If present, this will be used as favicon.

 =local.css= :: Additional CSS rules.

 =local.js= :: Local JS file. Here you can do whatever you want
               without tampering with the code. Open an issue on
               [[https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki/issues][GitHub]]
               if you think you miss IDs in the HTML to hook on.

 =navlogo.png= :: If present, it will be placed on the navigation bar
                  as logo. Height is enforced to 50px.

 =widebanner.png= :: If present, it's used to place a banner below the
                     navbar (which is fixed). It should have a width
                     of 1170px for optimal results.

 =pagelogo.png= :: If present, it will be placed before the latest
                   entries on the special pages. The assigned ids are
                   "special-pages-logo" for the container and
                   "special-pages-logo-img" for the image itself.

 =opengraph.png= :: If present, it will be used for the [[http://ogp.me/][opengraph protocol]]
                    (used on social networks when sharing a
                    link). The image opengraph.png should have
                    dimension 300x300 for better effect. If not
                    present, pagelogo.png will be used, otherwise
                    navlogo.png will be used, with often odd results.
